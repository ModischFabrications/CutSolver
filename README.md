This API can be used to solve the common problem of finding the perfect placement of cuts for specified lengths.
It seems like no other free service tackles this specific problem in an easy-to-use format, so this is my attempt.

You are very welcome to share how you use this tool!

This Solver is using integers exclusively, as there is no need for arbitrary precision (yet).
Feel free to shift your numbers a few decimals if you need fractions.
It has no concept of units, so you can use whatever you want.

*Nerd talk*: This is the 2D "Cutting Stock Problem", which is NP-hard. It can be reduced to the Bin-Packing-Problem (
BPP).
No efficient algorithm exists to calculate a perfect solution in an acceptable timeframe, therefore brute force (perfect
solution)
is used for small jobs (<13 entries) and FFD (fast solution) fÃ¼r larger ones. Don't be surprised if you get different
results,
many combinations have equal trimmings and are therefore seen as equally good.

## Usage

*This is a backend, see [CutSolverFrontend](https://github.com/ModischFabrications/CutSolverFrontend) for a human usable
version.*

Feel free to run manually, but the easiest (and advised) way to deploy this is by using Docker and pulling an up-to-date
image.

Send POST-Requests to `[localhost]/solve` to get your results, see `/docs` for further information.

### Docker

You don't need to check out this repository and build your own image, I am pushing prebuild ones to Docker Hub.
Download and start this container by using the provided docker-compose file or
with `docker run [--rm -it] -p80:80 modischfabrications/cutsolver:latest`.

Note: Replace `latest` with a version number if you depend on this interface, I can guarantee you that the interface
will change randomly. It's not like I know what I'm doing, expect a learning curve.

Both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm/v7` are currently supported, more will be build whenever I get around to it, message
me if
you need another architecture.

## Performance

If it can run Docker it will probably be able to run CutSolver.
1 vCPU with 500MB RAM should be fine for small workloads.

Runtimes strongly depend on the single-core performance of your CPU.
You can expect 10 entries to be solved after ~20s with `bruteforce`and <0.1s with `FFD` for generic desktops, slower on
weaker machines.
Multiple cores won't speed up job time, but will enable efficient solving of parallel jobs.

## Contributing

Feel free to contact me or make a pull-request if you want to participate.

Install pre-commit with `pre-commit install && pre-commit install -t pre-push`.

This should be checked and or fixed by pre-commit, execute `pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage push` to run
manually.

Change version number in main.py:version for newer releases, git tags will be created automatically.

Remember to test your changes using `pytest [--durations=5]`.

### Development Docker Images

1. Build and start this image using `docker-compose up`
2. wait a while for dependencies to build... (1000s)
3. Hope that everything works

### Push Production Docker Images

Docker Hub Images should be updated automatically, but that doesn't work at the moment (see #44).
Thankfully, local builds are easy with the modern `buildx` workflow.

Installation of a multibuilder (once):

```
docker buildx create --name multibuilder --use
docker buildx inspect multibuilder --bootstrap
```

Build and push the new multi-arch image with the following steps (add version, e.g. v0.3.7):

```
docker login -u modischfabrications
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm/v7 \
    -t modischfabrications/cutsolver:<VERSION> \
    -t modischfabrications/cutsolver:latest --push .
```

Wait a while for every dependency to build (~1000s) and all layers to be pushed (~400s).

Check [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/modischfabrications/cutsolver) to see results.

## Dependencies

*Everything should be handled by Docker and/or pipenv*

This project uses:

* [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv): library management
* [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi): easy webservice (this includes much more!)
* [httpie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie): simpler `curl` for docker healthchecks
